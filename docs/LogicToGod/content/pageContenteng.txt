A philosophical work must begin with shared foundations. One such foundation is the concept of truth. Truth is that which aligns with reality.

If someone observes a red chair and claims it is a blue parrot, the statement is false—not because of opinion, but because it fails to correspond with what is. Truth corresponds to being.

What is reality? Reality is that which exists independently of our thoughts or perceptions. Our senses offer us access to this reality, though imperfectly. We augment our senses with instruments and logic to more accurately apprehend what is real.

But how do we know there is a reality independent of our perception? How do we know we are not dreaming? René Descartes addressed this with the phrase “I think, therefore I am.” Even if all else is illusion, the existence of the thinker is confirmed. There is, at minimum, a subject experiencing perception. This existence, even if limited to the self, must be accounted for.

Now we examine the possible explanations for existence—whether of the world or the self.

<b>Possibility one: There exists an independent world.</b>

This world either always existed or began to exist. If it began, there must be a cause. Either that cause is itself caused, leading to a chain of causes, or it is uncaused—a first cause. This first cause is what we call God: not a being within the chain, but the unconditioned source of the chain.

If the world always existed, this implies an infinite regress of causes extending backward in time. What remains unaccounted for is why such a sequence exists at all. Even an eternal chain of dependent events is contingent. The fact that the sequence continues requires a sustaining ground for its ongoing existence. That unconditioned ground, which upholds the totality of being whether finite or infinite, is what we call God.

<b>Possibility two: The world is not independent, but imagined.</b>

Even in this scenario, the imagined world obeys consistent laws. We do not fly by thinking, nor dissolve objects by disbelief. There is an order beyond our control. This consistency points to a logic deeper than our will. The structure that makes the imagined world coherent is not of our making. That higher logical order is what we call God.

<b>Alternativly: The self exists, either eternally or by coming into being.</b>

If we, the subject, began to exist, the same causal logic applies: there must be a reason or cause. If we always existed, we face the same issue of infinite regress or sustaining necessity. In all cases, we are confronted by the need for an unconditioned ground for our being. That is what we mean by God.

Thus, across all logically possible scenarios—whether of an external world or internal subjectivity—existence demands an unconditioned source. This source does not itself depend on anything else. It is necessary, not contingent. This is the foundational meaning of God: unconditional being.

Truth is not personal. It is not how we feel. All truth claims must be justified by reason, coherence, and consistency with reality. Without this, we have only speculation or opinion.

To live in truth is to live in alignment with what is. Since God is the structure of what is, to live truthfully is to live in alignment with God. No one compels this life. It is not enforced. But to live in truth is to live by a standard beyond culture, beyond whim, beyond passing norms. It is to live by the unchanging.
